Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Which classmates did you consult with while working on this assignment? 
  Peace, Mellisa

- Which session(s) of TA / office hours did you attend? 
  Monday 7-9 (TA)

- What are your initial impressions of Java? 
  DIFFICULT TO NAVIGATE AND PROCEED

- Can you draw any conclusion about programming in general from the similarities or the differences between the two languages? 
  Comparatively, python is easier to go through after pseudo coding, however, I felt java had more complex syntaxes and i had to resort to different ways because I couldn't compile it using easier methods that I would've applied if I'd code it in python.

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
  TA hours were very helpful. I guess looking through different materials out of class helped. For future students, I think just being in the class insn't enough to write programs, we need to work on it individually for a longer time.
